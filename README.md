# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Project revolves around a meticulous analysis of bank customer churn patterns, offering valuable insights into retention strategies. By scrutinizing credit scores across different geographies, I uncover the regions with the highest scores. I examine the relationship between age groups and average credit scores, shedding light on generational financial behaviors. Furthermore, I delve into the interplay of card types and age groups, revealing preferences. Gender-based churn rates and geographical churn disparities are explored comprehensively. Through distribution analysis, I present a clear picture of churn occurrences. Gender distribution in relation to credit card usage is elucidated, and a correlation heatmap provides in-depth connections.
